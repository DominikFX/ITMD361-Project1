  <h1>Food Experince</h1>
  <p>Food as well as the process of making it has always been a big part of my intrest and I've enjoyed all forms of it. I like cooking just as much as I love trying new foods and learning about them. Cooking shows were some of my favorites growing up, especially the ones that featured Gordon Ramsey. Even though the shows involved a lot of yelling, it created a new sense of appriciation for how the food is made and the effort that goes into it.</p>
